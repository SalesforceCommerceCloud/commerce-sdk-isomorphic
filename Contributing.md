## Building

To create the SDK package:

```
# Install dependencies needed to run generation
$ yarn install

# Parse API files, render templates to src/lib folder and copy static files to src/lib
$ yarn run renderTemplates

# Launch sample application
$ yarn start

# Transpile and minify
$ yarn build:lib

# Run tests
$ yarn test
```

## Usage

An example React App is available at `./src/environment/App` directory. To use the sample application, configure these parameters in `./src/environment/config.js` file.

> **Note:** These are required parameters.

| Parameter      | Description                                                                |
| -------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| clientId       | ID of the client account created with Salesforce Commerce.                 |
| organizationId | The unique identifier for your Salesforce identity.                        |
| shortCode      | Region-specific merchant ID.                                               |
| siteId         | Name of the site to access data from, for example, RefArch or SiteGenesis. |

```javascript
/**
 * Configure required parameters
 *
 * To learn more about the parameters please refer to https://developer.commercecloud.com/s/article/CommerceAPI-Get-Started
 */
// Create a configuration to use when creating API clients
const config = {
  proxy: 'https://localhost:3000',
  headers: {},
  parameters: {
    clientId: '<your-client-id>',
    organizationId: '<your-org-id>',
    shortCode: '<your-short-code>',
    siteId: '<your-site-id>',
  },
};
```

Launch the sample application using `yarn start`. Access the sample application using a new browser window at this URL `localhost:3000`.

## Testing

Two types of tests occur when running `yarn test`. First, unit tests are executed with jest including an enforced coverage level. This is all tests not contained within the sample app path of `src/environment`. If that passes, tests within the sample app path are executed using the `react-scripts` configuration. These allow for testing of the SDK within a sample React application.

## Issues

If you’re experiencing an issue, check the open issues first. If someone hasn’t already raised the same issue, file a new issue with a description of the problem and describe the steps to reproduce it. If you require an urgent response to your issue, file a support ticket with [Salesforce Commerce Cloud](https://help.salesforce.com/). You can also create an issue to request a new feature.

## Best Practices

- To reduce merge conflicts, squash and rebase your branch before submitting your pull request.
- In your pull request, include:
  - A brief description of the problem and your solution
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Screenshots
  - Error logs (if applicable)
- Make sure that your code builds successfully and passes the unit tests.
- Monitor your pull requests. Respond in a timely manner to any comments, questions, and change requests.
