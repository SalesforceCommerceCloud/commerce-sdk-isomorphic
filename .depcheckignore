# This file is required because otherwise depcheck will skip checking files in the .gitignore,
# but we want to check some of those files (namely, the generated code in /src/lib).

# We don't strictly need to ignore /apis and /docs, because there's nothing in them that depcheck
# recognizes, but we can get a minor performance boost by skipping all of those files.
/apis
/docs
/node_modules
