    # API Overview
    Use the Shopper Experience API to look up page information for pages that are created in Page Designer, content assets and to access content folders.

    ## Pages
    Responses for pages include the following:

    - The entire component hierarchy of the page at design time.
    - All merchant data provided at design time.
    - Server-side scripting data provided at run time.

    Both the page and components contain the values of all native and custom attributes that have been populated during page authoring.

    Only visible pages are returned. Because the visibility of components is driven by rules (scheduling or customer groups, for example), these rules are subject to evaluation when assembling the component hierarchy in the response. Only components that are visible for the current customer context appear in the response. The same rules apply to the page itself, which is only be processed and returned if it is visible.

    ## Content Assets

    Content asset responses include:

    - Rich content including text, HTML, and images
    - SEO metadata (title, description, keywords)
    - Template information for rendering
    - Folder organization structure
    - Custom attributes and properties

    Only content assets that are marked as online are returned. Content assets provide flexible content management capabilities for storefronts.

    ## Content Folders
    The API also provides access to content folders, which are used to organize and manage content assets. Content folders support:

    - Hierarchical organization with nested subfolders
    - Localized metadata including names, descriptions, and SEO attributes
    - Custom attributes for extended functionality
    - Configurable depth levels for subfolder retrieval (0, 1, or 2 levels)

    Only content folders that are marked as online are returned in the API responses.

    ## Authentication & Authorization

    The Shopper Experience API requires a shopper access token from the Shopper Login and API Access Service (SLAS).

    For details on how to request a shopper access token from SLAS, see the guest user flows for [public clients](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/commerce-api/guide/slas-public-client.html#guest-user) and [private clients](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/commerce-api/guide/slas-private-client.html#guest-user) in the SLAS guides.

    You must include the relevant scope(s) in the client ID used to generate the SLAS token. For details, see the [Authorization Scopes Catalog.](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/commerce-api/guide/auth-z-scope-catalog.html).

    **Important**: Currently, the Shopper Experience Pages endpoints can’t be used when the [storefront password protection](https://documentation.b2c.commercecloud.salesforce.com/DOC1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.demandware.dochelp%2Fcontent%2Fb2c_commerce%2Ftopics%2Fpermissions%2Fb2c_storefront_password_protection.html&resultof=%22%73%74%6f%72%65%66%72%6f%6e%74%22%20%22%70%72%6f%74%65%63%74%69%6f%6e%22%20%22%70%72%6f%74%65%63%74%22%20) feature is enabled.

          This type supports additional properties passed along with the defined properties of this API.
          To indicate that the properties were defined and expected to be handled as additional properties, they are expected to be prefixed with a `c_`.
          The type will reject any property that does not fit this pattern, only allowing additional properties beginning with the known prefix.
