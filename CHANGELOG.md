# CHANGELOG

## v3.0.0

### :warning: Planned Shopper Context Changes :warning: 

Starting July 31st 2024, all endpoints in the Shopper context API will require the `siteId` parameter for new customers. This field is marked as optional for backward compatibility and will be changed to mandatory tentatively by January 2025.

### Enchancements

- Update SLAS helper function `loginGuestUserPrivate` to require `channel_id` as SLAS requires `channel_id` when requesting a guest access token with a `grant_type` of `client_credentials` starting July 31st 2024 [#165](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/commerce-sdk-isomorphic/pull/165)

For more information about prerequisites and sample usage, see [URL Resolution](/docs/commerce/commerce-api/guide/url-resolution.html). You can customize the behavior of this endpoint by using hooks. See the hooks for getUrlMapping in the [Hook List](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/commerce-api/guide/hook_list.html). |

## v1.11.0

#### Enhancements

* Add support for Shopper Login (SLAS) prviate client with helper functions [#148](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/commerce-sdk-isomorphic/pull/140)

## v1.10.2

#### Documentation
- Descriptions for certain `shopper-login` and `shopper-context` operations have been updated on [generated documentation site](https://salesforcecommercecloud.github.io/commerce-sdk-isomorphic/)

## v1.10.1

#### Bug fixes

- The 'To is not a function' [issue](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/commerce-sdk-isomorphic/issues/122) is fixed.

## v1.10.0

#### Enhancements

- Cookies are disabled by default.
- The cross-fetch dependency has been removed. Now commerce-sdk-isomorphic uses native fetch in browser and node-fetch library in node. This has potential impact for client implementations. Passing `fetchOptions: {redirect: 'manual'}` as called on the server-side to prevent following of redirects prior to this upgrade had no effect on the client because `cross-fetch` used `XMLHttpRequest` and was silently ignored. The new approach respects this `redirect: 'manual'` directive, potentially causing redirects on the client (given these optional parameters) to not be followed, which breaks flows including the SLAS `authorizeCustomer` method, which could fail with an `opaqueredirect` error.
